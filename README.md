👋 Hi there, I’m @kritarth17!

👀 I’m interested in exploring the intersection of technology and creativity, diving into the depths of psychology, and unraveling the mysteries of the universe through science and philosophy.

🌱 I’m currently learning the ropes of data science and machine learning, while also delving into the art of storytelling through various mediums.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that fuse innovation with empathy, where we can collectively create meaningful solutions to real-world problems.
